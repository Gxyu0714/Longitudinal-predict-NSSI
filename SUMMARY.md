# Project Organization Summary

## Files Created

1. **consolidated_nssi_prediction.py** - A single Python file containing the complete workflow
   - Data processing pipeline (loading, cleaning, missing value handling)
   - Prediction modeling pipeline (feature selection, model training, validation)
   - Comprehensive documentation and comments

2. **README.md** - Comprehensive project documentation
   - Project overview and methodology
   - Detailed explanation of each processing step
   - Clear description of the prediction pipeline
   - Usage instructions and requirements

3. **requirements.txt** - Python dependencies list
   - All necessary packages for running the code

## Methodology Summary

The project follows a two-phase approach:

### Phase 1: Data Processing
- Wide-to-long format transformation for longitudinal analysis
- NSSI variable creation from DSH scores
- Multi-stage missing value imputation:
  * Temporal rule-based filling for age/grade
  * Forward/backward fill for continuous variables
  * KNN imputation for remaining missing values
  * Mode imputation for categorical variables

### Phase 2: Prediction Modeling
- LSTM-based temporal feature selection
- Random Forest classification
- Three validation schemes:
  * Fixed split
  * Sliding window
  * Cumulative learning

## Confidentiality Compliance

All sensitive data elements have been removed or abstracted to comply with:
- No actual data files included
- Generic variable names used in examples
- No personally identifiable information exposed
- Methodology described without revealing specific values

## Next Steps

The consolidated code file provides a complete template that can be adapted for similar longitudinal prediction tasks while maintaining data privacy and security.
